# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose:
To adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. In order for us to do this, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web-application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomadate the images.

## Step 1:
- Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we will scrape full resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images.

## Step 2:
- Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Using Python and HTML, we will add the code we created in Step 1 to my scraping.py file, update my Mongo database, and modify my index.html file so the webpage contains all the information we collected as well as the full-resoltuion image and title for each hemisphere.

## Step 3:
- Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  - Updating my web app to make it mobile-responsive, and adding two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
